# COMP-3211
These are the files for my COMP 3211 course (Introduction to AI).

This is a project that that makes a language processing model that is able to output the degree of 'goodness' of a sentence given to the model. It consists of us trying different hypothesis of models and RNN networks and making observations and analysing the result to get the best prediction/score.
